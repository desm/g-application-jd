My thoughts
- I need to use Gumroad myself
- people use apps for notifications, and dashboards, and reading, and watching, in that order
- noticed that Sahil said that the more equity people choose, the better for the company

include in job application
- floorplan
- 12:39 - include what you think is next??? review video
